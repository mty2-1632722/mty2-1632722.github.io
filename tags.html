		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p> My name is Mariko Yorita and I am currently a sophomore at UW pursuing a degree in Business Administration. I like money, and learning how to control it, so I am drawn to courses like economics, finance, and accounting. </p>
		<p> I enjoy being outdoors, and playing sports such as swimming, softball, and golf. I also enjoy watching the local sports teams like the Seahwaks, and Mariners. </p>
		<p> If I were only able to have one thing in the world, it would be a dog. Dogs are so sweet, and comforting to me, it would be impossible to live without them. </p>
